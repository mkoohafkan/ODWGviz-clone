# ODWGviz


An R package for visualizing outlier detection routines provided by
the [`ODWGtools`](https://github.com/mkoohafkan/ODWGtools-clone/) package.

This is a clone of a package I developed while working for the
California Department of Water Resources. I have kept this
snapshot of my work as a learning tool/reference/example.
The original package is now maintained by others and
is available to the public: https://github.com/ODWG/ODWGviz.
